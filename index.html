			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<p>
				Hello World, my name is Kyle! I'm not a professional developer. However, I do want the site to look decent, and function well enough for the user to get around. Something to know about me is I'm not big on the ideology of ripping code off of tutorials, so something as simple as the drop-down menu doesn't move right all the time, and hardly works on mobile platforms, but it works for now and I really don't want to risk breaking the site and wasting an afternoon fixing something that does what I want/need it to do. In the future I'll come back to it, probably. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				As far as who I am, as opposed to a small rant about the the drop drop down, I'm a college student. My major: Engineering Tech, and my hobbies include Programming & Dungeons & Dragons. That sums up me. The programs I made, originally in Python, were specifically for the purpose of automating my life making Dungeons & Dragons content. Be it the generation of different creatures health, or a really odd program that allow the input of months, number days in each month, etc..., etc..., and eventually it would spit out a calendar for you. It was useful for me because I could accurately advance my calendar's 100+ years into the future, and the days of the week would still be accurate.
			</p>
				
			<p>
				Something other than Dungeons & Dragons, or programming.... I like electricity, and in the engineering field I'm currently pursuing the occupation of a Controls Engineer. To sum up a controls engineer, they program... yes program... Programmable Logic Controllers(PLC's) which are like Arduino's, but on an industrial scale. They manage inputs and outputs. Other than all of that, let us discuss the site a bit more, why I have one, and my future plans for it.
			</p>

			<h1>The Site</h1>

			<p>
				A static website developed entirely by yours truly. As previously stated, I'm no professional developer, with little passion for Front-End development. However, I'm sure as I get better with HTML, CSS, and learning the ins-and-outs of JS I will like it more. It's hosted by GitHub pages, as you can tell by it's domain. Feel free to go <b><i><a href="https://github.com/Casual-Kyle/Casual-Kyle.github.io">HERE</a></i></b> and critique my work if you find the website absolutely disgusting. My currently goal for the site is an entirely static site, which I believe is all that is offered by GitHub pages, but this will force me to do everything in JS which is the primary reason I wanted to create a site. <i>To explain: I'm bad at JS, and MMO's like &#60;Screeps&#62;_ exist, thusly I want to learn JS. However, JS is plain fun to program in anyway, so we'll see what happens</i>...  
			</p>

			<p>
				So JavaScript(JS) is the purpose of the site. My projects will be purely for the benefit of myself, but hopefully others find them useful should they stumble on this sight somehow. The projects below on this page will probably just small things I'm learning to ease myself into JS. You understand, but stick around and maybe you'll see something you like in the days to come.
