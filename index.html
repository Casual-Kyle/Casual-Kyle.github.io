			<h1>A little about me and this site</h1>

			<p>
				I'm a 21 year old college student who is an Engineering student who programs as a hobby. My original desire to program started off simply enough as it was just a desire to program LUA for a Minecraft mod. After awhile this desire faded, and this hobby faded away. As I entered my third year of Uni. as a transfer student I began my major courses. To my surprise a decent amount of my major involved programming. It began with C++ courses, and then moved on to Python where I really found my strive. 
			</p>
			
			<p>

				Not only because Python is super simple to pick up, but very fun. Not that I don't respect the language of C++, but Python can make very powerful programs very quickly due to it's large libraries and simple syntax. Then as I learned of video games like Screep's that use Javascript in their games to make scripts I had the desire to learn JS as to join in on the fun of this unique MMO. Thusly this website has been born due to the free version of Github Pages, and it will be my way of learning Javascript.
			</p>
				
			<p>
				A passion of mine is Dungeons and Dragons, and having the ability to know reprogram all of my Python programs in JS is exciting. This site will be my main hobby, and downtime sink. I will make new programs, in the hopes of mastering Javascript and giving back to the D&D / Nerd community at the same time.
