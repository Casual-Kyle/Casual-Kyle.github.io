				Finished up the Char. Stat. Roller on the General page to finally show recommended classes. And by Finally, I mean in the day since I started it. The code isn't "Spaghetti code", or at least I hope it isn't. I can feel myself improving, and feeling more comfortable with JS. Might take a day or two programming break, but odds are I'll try my hand at something.

				Finished up the Character Stat Roller on the <i>General</i> page, however wanted to suddenly add a recommended class piece of text so I added some new JS code. Hopefully finish it up tomorrow. Changed the .css file on the general page to float the text to the right of the actual 'Stat Bar', or the boxes of stats as it were. Adjusted the height of the page with the content box being set to a higher, min-height because the content box wasn't filling the page up entirely. Hopefully I'll find a better fix for this, but who knows. Made the content section on the <i>General</i> page have a higher min-height all together instead of adjusting the content for all the pages on the style.css, because you can do that in css and it's awesome.

				Finished up the Dice Roller to my current satisfaction, and then continued on to make the Random Stat Gen JS function. Most of the work today was CSS, and a little JS, however I didn't have much time to work on it today anyway. Probably more work tomorrow, however I have a bit of other stuff to do, so maybe not.

				The General Pages was created, composed of the files general_script.js, general_style.css, and general.html. This page will act as all of the small projects I will use to learn JavaScript(JS), and could potentially house the same project twice. Today I wrote a type of Dice Roller that I want to either improve our make several different ways. Other than that this page is now in place and will be a place of near-future development.

				The first post of the Developer Blog section. A typed blog post, for this new static website. The index.html page has been set up, and I'm still contemplating what to do with it. I'm contemplating putting up some beginner projects on it, to display my progression. I've added a dropdown menu, of my own devising so it's not as clean as some I've seen online. However, it is mine and it will get better as I become more proficient with JavaScript. Hopefully.... Regardless the website is now linked to my GitHub, and my YouTube where I will eventually upload JavaScript(JS) videos of my projects. Mainly so I can track my own progress.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Later that day... So I've added some basic JS to the page, made some changes to the way the screen orientates it's width and font of the sidebar as the screen size changes. It's not perfect, but it's my first day and I so despise just ripping code off from other people. So it's my own code, with trial and error. Except for the RandomColor function. I will admit I ripped that off, as I'm not used to making random numbers in this language yet, without Python's
				<i>import random, random.randint()</i>. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				To spice up the page I've added a onclick() feature to the Header, which if clicking on the Title will change it's color, and clicking on the Subtitle it will make a kind of 'Splash' text which I drew inspiration from Minecraft for.
